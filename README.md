# Early Prediction of Sepsis

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict sepsis among patients early on based on their clinical data.
The data used for this project is from the 2019 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge: https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/

Dataset consists of 2 parts: training set A (20,336 subjects) and B (20,000 subjects). The data repository contains one file per subject (e.g., training/p00101.psv for the training data). Each training data file provides a table with measurements over time. Each column of the table provides a sequence of measurements over time (e.g., heart rate over several hours), where the header of the column describes the measurement. Each row of the table provides a collection of measurements at the same time (e.g., heart rate and oxygen level at the same time).

The remainder of this readme will cover the different steps in the project pipeline. We will update this as we proceed with the project.
